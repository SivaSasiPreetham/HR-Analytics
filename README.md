**The HR department at Salifort Motors seeks to employee retention, that is they want to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company.**

*Assuming the role of Data Professional in the analytics team, my part is to give Data Driven Suggestions after finding the most crucial factors for Employee Turnover. Starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Visualization** , I chose **Tree based Machine learning Model**, where I conducted two **Decision Tree** rounds on the Dataset to predict whether an employee will leave and identify which factors are most influential. 1st round gives us predictions while 2nd round gives real scores of the predictions.*
