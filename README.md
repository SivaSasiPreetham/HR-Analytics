**The HR department at Salifort Motors seeks to employee retention, that is they want to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company.**

*Assuming the role of Data Professional in the analytics team I gave data driven suggestions based on whether an emplyee will leave the company or not. Starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Visualization** , I chose **Tree based Machine learning Model**, where I conducted two **Decision Tree** rounds on the Dataset to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not. 1st round gives us predictions while 2nd round improves the scores of the predictions.*
